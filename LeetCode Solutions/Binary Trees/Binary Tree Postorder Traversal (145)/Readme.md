# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints:
1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
2. -100 <= Node.val <= 100
