# Permutations II

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/)

Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.


The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output:
[[1,1,2],
 [1,2,1],
 [2,1,1]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

## Constraints:
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 8
2. -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
