[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints:
1. The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
2. -10**5 <= Node.val <= 10**5

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?
