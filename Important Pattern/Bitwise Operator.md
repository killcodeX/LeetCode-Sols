# Bitwise Operator

## XOR ( ^ )

Return the rightmost 1 in the binary representation of a number.

Example: For 1010, you should perform some operations to give 0010 as the output. For 1100, you should give 0100. Similarly for 0001, you should return 0001.

Youâ€™ll need to know the following properties

* n ^ n = 0
* n ^ 0 = n
