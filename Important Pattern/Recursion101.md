# Recursion Hacks


## How to approach a recursion problems?

* Identify if you can break down problems into smaller problems
* Write the recursion relations if needed
* Draw the recursion treee
* About the tree:-
    * See the floe of functions, how they are getting in stack.
    * Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.

    * Draw the tree and pointers again n again using pen and paper, use a debugger to see the flow.
* See how the values and what types of value are returned at each step.
* See when the function calls will come out of stack
