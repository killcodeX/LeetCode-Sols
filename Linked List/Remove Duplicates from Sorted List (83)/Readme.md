# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints:
1. The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
2. -100 <= Node.val <= 100
3. The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?
